            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Im a recent college grad with a degree in Business Administration. Born and raised on military bases across South Korea, I am what you would call a “military brat.” I currently reside in North Carolina and am an avid Tar Heels fan. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, reading and playing games. 
                I’m hoping to obtain a career in Web Development upon completing this bootcamp.</p>
